## About JWT


Laravel JWT (JSON Web Token) is a popular package used in Laravel applications to handle token-based authentication. It provides a simple and secure way to authenticate and authorize users by issuing and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

The primary package used for implementing JWT in Laravel is called "tymon/jwt-auth." This package integrates seamlessly with Laravel's authentication system, allowing you to generate JWTs for authenticated users and protect routes based on token authentication.
